Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification

Instructions:
You can find our notebook named "DogBreed_Classifier.ipynb" which contains all the code for the model. In order to run the code, run each cell block in sequential order (in Google Colab). All the necessary files/data will be automatically downloaded off a public GitHub repository.

Output file:
The file "Image Classifier Output" contains all the output statistics/plots pertaining to the project. You can also refer to specific cell blocks within the notebook file for further analysis.

NOTE: Running the notebook file requires a lot of Google Colab tokens (if you're running it on Colab). Your run may be interrupted if you use the base version of Google Colab.
